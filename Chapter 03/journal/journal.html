    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>

    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway</p>

    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some intresting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why AZ and truth or consequences, NM</p>

    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burna Shave style signs on the side of the road today.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, When you cant see, May get you a glimpse of eternity. 
    </blockquote>
    <p>I definitely wont be passing any cars.</p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I cant believe finally got something packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera and a protien bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begin with a Segway.</q></p>
